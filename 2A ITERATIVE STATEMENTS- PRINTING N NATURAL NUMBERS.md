## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING N NATURAL NUMBERS

###  Aim
To create a Python program for printing `n` natural numbers using a `for` loop.

---

###  Algorithm

1. Begin the program.
2. Use `input()` to read the value of `n` (the upper limit) from the user.
3. Convert the input to an integer.
4. Display the message **"Natural Numbers are :"**.
5. Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
6. In each iteration, print the current value of `i`.
7. Terminate the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
#Reg.NO
#Name : DEEPIKA v
#n=int(input())
print("Natural Numbers are :")
for i in range(1,n+1,1):
    print(i)

```
### OUTPUT
```![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81c3eded-3d7d-4fde-a53d-f1ce5a22447f)


```
### RESULT
Thus the python program for printing n natural numbers has been implemented and executed successfully.
